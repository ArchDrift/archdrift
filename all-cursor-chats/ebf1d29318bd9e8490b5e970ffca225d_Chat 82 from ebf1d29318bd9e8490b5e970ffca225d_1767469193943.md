I just need to clean up the Summary Report UI to make it professional. Please implement these 4 visual changes:

Consolidate Header: Remove the double instances of the integrity score. The header should only have the Structural Integrity Index: XX.X% and the visual progress bar [█████████░].

Clean Summary Text: Remove the 'Weighted Debt' math explanation (multipliers and density math) from the summary. Keep that in the full details log only.

Update Pattern Table: Change the severity indicators in the Pattern Breakdown table to: 🔴 Critical (Layer), 🟠 High (N+1), 🟡 Medium (God Class).

Add Expert Diagnosis: Insert a new section titled '### 🧠 Expert Diagnosis' immediately under the progress bar. Use this dynamic logic:

Hotspot: Find the most frequent directory in the Top 5 Offenders.

Threat: Identify the violation pattern with the highest weighted impact.

Generate: 'The primary source of architectural drift is located in the [Hotspot]. Systemic [Primary Pattern] violations indicate that the system's [Risk Factor] is beginning to compromise its structural integrity.' > - (Map: Layer=Logic Boundaries, N+1=Performance Scalability, God Class=Maintenance Velocity
