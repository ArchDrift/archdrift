Create a stress test script stress_test.py that interacts with my shell. The script should:

Burst Fire: Send 100 simple commands (echo test) to the shell as fast as possible and verify each one returns a 0 exit code.

The 'Bomb' Test: Send a massive 50,000-character string to the prompt to check for buffer overflows or parsing crashes.

Invalid Execution: Attempt to run 50 non-existent commands in a row and ensure the shell remains responsive.

Leak Detection: Monitor and report the shell's RAM usage before and after these 150+ commands to ensure Python isn't 'leaking' memory.

Run this test against my current shell code and give me a 'Stability Score' out of 100."

Understanding the "Stability Score"
When the agent finishes, look at the memory data. Because Python uses Garbage Collection, you might see RAM go up slightly and then stay there. That is normal. However, if the RAM keeps climbing with every command, your shell is "leaking" objects.

When are you 100% "Done"?
You can consider this project complete when:

Stress Test Score: 100/100 (No crashes).

Zombie Count: 0 (Run tasklist on Windows or ps on Linux after the test; you shouldn't see dozens of cmd or echo processes still alive).

The "Vibe" is Consistent: The shell feels just as fast on the 1,000th command as it did on the 1st.
