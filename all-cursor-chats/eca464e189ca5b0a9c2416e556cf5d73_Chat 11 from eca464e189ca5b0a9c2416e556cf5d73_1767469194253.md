"The shell is now production-ready. Let's package it into a high-performance standalone executable for Windows.

Install: Install pyinstaller in the current environment.

Configuration: Create a build command that:

Uses --onefile to bundle everything into a single .exe.

Uses --name PyShell for the output file.

Uses --console to ensure it runs correctly in a terminal window.

Uses --clean to remove temporary cache files.

Path Handling: Ensure that internal paths for the $status logic and scripting runner still work when the app is 'frozen' (hint: check for sys._MEIPASS if we use external data files, though for pure logic it should be fine).

Execute: Run the build and tell me when the final PyShell.exe is ready in the /dist folder
