## unknown

I need to run a benchmarking suite. Please follow these steps in order:

Step 1: Engine Audit

Scan the files in ./engine.

If the main analysis and SII calculation functions are not already exported, please modify the files to add export keywords. We need these to be accessible by external scripts.

Step 2: Create pilot-audit.ts

Create a script that imports the now-exported functions from ./engine.

It should iterate through each repo in ./pilot-repos.

Exclusion Rules: Automatically skip node_modules, dist, build, .git, .next, coverage, and __tests__. Skip any file with .test. or .spec. in the name.

Format: Save a SUMMARY.md (High-level) and a FULL_DETAILS.md (Detailed list of violations) in ./results/[repo-name]/.

Step 3: Global Leaderboard

After scanning all 9 repos, generate a LEADERBOARD.md in the root ranking them by SII score (95+ S, 85+ A, 70+ B, 50+ C, <50 F)
