## unknown

i am trying to have you do this. r u doing this right? Fix Instructions
STEP 1: Tell Cursor to create a .vscode folder inside your driftguard folder if it doesn't exist.

STEP 2: Tell Cursor to generate two files:

First file: launch.json inside .vscode - this tells VS Code "run as extension"

Second file: tasks.json inside .vscode - this tells VS Code to compile TypeScript first

STEP 3: After Cursor generates those files, close and reopen VS Code in the driftguard folder.

STEP 4: Now press F5. It should automatically launch a new window titled "Extension Development Host" without asking what debugger to use.
