## unknown

I have an experimental version of the scoring engine in another folder. I want you to sync the logic into this project's src/ directory.

Instructions:

Read the calculateSII and violation weighing logic from C:\Users\Prajeesh\Downloads\Benchmark\engine\analyzer.ts
Update src/analyzer.ts and src/extension.ts in this project to match that logic exactly (specifically the Logarithmic Floor and Density weights).

Create a new file at .cursor/rules/scoring-logic.mdc that formalizes these formulas as the 'Source of Truth' for this repository.

Once done, verify the implementation by explaining how it would score a repository with a Violation Density of 0.8."
