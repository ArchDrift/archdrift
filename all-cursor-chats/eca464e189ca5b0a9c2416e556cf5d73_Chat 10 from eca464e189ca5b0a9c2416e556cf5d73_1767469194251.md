The execution engine is solid. Now, let's implement Conditional Scripting Logic to make the shell a true interpreter.

Exit Code Tracking: Ensure every command stores its result (0 for success, non-zero for failure) in a variable called $status.

Internal if Blocks: Add a simple parser that recognizes: if [condition] then [command] Example: if $status != 0 then echo "Command Failed!"

Logical Chaining: Implement && and || (e.g., mkdir test && cd test). This is a hallmark of professional shells.

In-Process Evaluation: Ensure this logic is evaluated internally by Python so it remains instantaneous (referencing our benchmark data).

Documentation: Update README.md to reflect that PyShell now supports Conditional Execution Flow."
