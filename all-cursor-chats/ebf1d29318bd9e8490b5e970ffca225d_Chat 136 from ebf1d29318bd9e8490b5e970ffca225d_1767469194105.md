Stop Existing Processes: Stop any hanging or background tasks.

Bash

pkill -f tsc
pkill -f typescript
Exclude the Audit Bloat (Crucial): You must prevent TypeScript from scanning the repositories you cloned for the Big 42 audit.

In tsconfig.json: Add your audit and results folders to the exclude array to keep the compiler focused on your src/ folder.

In .vscodeignore: Add these same folders here. This ensures that when you run vsce package, the final extension remains under 5MB rather than several gigabytes.

Deep Clean and Re-compile:

Bash

rm -rf out/
rm -rf node_modules/.cache/
npm run compile
Analysis of Current Errors
The "Command not found" error: This error occurs because VS Code reads your manifest (package.json) and shows the command, but since the compilation was stuck, the actual logic in out/extension.js was never created [Image 2]. The extension cannot "activate" without this compiled code.

Terminal Warning: The warning about 102,309 JavaScript files confirms that the packager is looking inside the cloned test repositories. Without a proper .vscodeignore, your extension will be too large to install and will likely be flagged as suspicious by the Marketplace security scans.
