Minor Polish: "Heavyweights" vs "Foundations" Cutoff
Observation:

You defined Heavyweights as > 1,000 files.

You defined Foundations as ≤ 1,000 files.

Correction: pnpm (1259 files) is in Heavyweights (correct). nest (1223 files) is in Heavyweights (correct).

Wait: prettier (468 production files) is in Heavyweights (Rank 1).

Why? It has 5372 Total Files. Your cutoff logic seems to be based on Total Files? Or is it arbitrary?

The Issue: Prettier (468 prod files) feels like a "Foundation/Tool" (it's a CLI) rather than an "App/Framework" like Angular.

Suggestion: Move Prettier to Foundations. It fits better with Turbo, tRPC, and SWC. It's a tool, not an app platform.

Why it matters: It leaves Storybook (1879 files) as the #1 Heavyweight, which is a much stronger narrative. "Storybook is the cleanest massive repo" is a great headline. "Prettier is the cleanest massive repo" is confusing because Prettier is small (only 468 prod files).

🚀 Final Polish Action Plan
Move prettier to the "Foundations" table.

Update the Directus Note to be neutral/scientific.

Check shadcn-ui (Rank 3 Heavyweight): It has 192 production files but 6023 total files? (Likely tons of individual component examples). Keep it in Heavyweights if you want, but it arguably fits "Foundations" (UI Lib) better.

Actually, leave it. 6000 total files makes it feel "heavy."
