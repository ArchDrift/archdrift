Refactor the analyzer so it first collects all raw issues into an array, then builds a grouped map by pattern with counts per pattern. Keep emitting individual diagnostics for click-to-code, but also compute a summary object with: total issues, total patterns, and count per pattern. Format diagnostic messages as [Pattern] details... so they appear grouped in the Problems panel.
