"The builtin echo is fast, but let's test process overhead. Benchmark the command whoami or hostname. This forces the shell to fork a new process. Compare that speed against Bash/CMD. If my shell is significantly slower here, look at how I am using subprocess.run vs os.exec and see if we can optimize the fork-exec chain."
