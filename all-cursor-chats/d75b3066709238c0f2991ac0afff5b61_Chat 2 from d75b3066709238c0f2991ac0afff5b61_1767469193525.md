Create a new file charts.html at the project root.
It should:

Load Chart.js from a CDN in a <script> tag.

On load, fetch ./src/chart-data/asymmetry.json and ./src/chart-data/looks-healthy.json.

Render two line charts:

“Asymmetry – Damage vs Recovery”: red line for accumulation.stress vs accumulation.steps, blue line for decay.stress vs decay.steps.

“Looks Healthy While Dying”: stepped yellow line with x = months, y = 1 for "active" and 0 for "collapsed".

Use a dark background and fixed canvas sizes (around 800×400) suitable for screenshots.

Work when opened directly from the filesystem (no bundler).
Do not modify any existing files, only add charts.html.
