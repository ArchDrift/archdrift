i am unablt to click people to reassign tasks not working. and also. make it more visually sleak. imagine line coways game of life. # AGENT INSTRUCTION: REBUILD UI AS EMERGENT SPATIAL SIMULATION

Target: Complete UI redesign from dashboard to Conway-inspired emergence visualization
Context: System models project degradation through deterministic consequence propagation
Architectural Constraints: Silence, irreversibility, resistance must be preserved throughout

---

## OBJECTIVE

Transform the current list-based dashboard UI into a continuous-time spatial simulation where:
- Consequence propagation is visible through motion and state changes
- No explanatory text appears during execution
- Visual complexity emerges from simple elements
- Observer intuits depth within 60 seconds without reading documentation

Reference model: Conway's Game of Life—minimal aesthetic, continuous motion, emergent patterns.
