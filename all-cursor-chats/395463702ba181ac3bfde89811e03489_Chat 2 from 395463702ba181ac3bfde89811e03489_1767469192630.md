The CodeCrafters Shell tests now pass for “Run a program” and “Locate executable files”.

The only failing stage is “Implement type”.



Here is the failing log:



text

[tester::#EZ5] Running tests for Stage #EZ5 (Implement type)

[tester::#EZ5] Running ./your_program.sh

[your-program] $ type echo

[your-program] /bin/echo

[tester::#EZ5] ^ Line does not match expected value.

[tester::#EZ5] Expected: "echo is a shell builtin"

[tester::#EZ5] Received: "/bin/echo"

Requirement: for shell builtins like echo, exit, type, pwd, and cd, type must print "<name> is a shell builtin" instead of a path. For non‑builtins, type should still search PATH and print the full path, or "<name>: not found" if missing.



The file app/main.py is open. Please update only the implementation of the type command to satisfy this behavior, keeping other commands and the external program logic unchanged. Show the full updated app/main.py and apply the edit.
