I need you to create a docs/ folder with 5 specification files in Markdown format.

The content for these files is in our conversation history at the beginning of this project (the 5 large text documents I pasted).

Create these files:

1. docs/01-conceptual-foundations.md
2. docs/02-architectural-invariants.md
3. docs/03-state-system-model.md
4. docs/04-stage-roadmap.md
5. docs/05-evaluation-framework.md

For each file:
- Use the content from the original specification documents
- Convert section headings to Markdown format:
  - Main titles: # Title
  - Major sections: ## Section Name
  - Subsections: ### Subsection Name
- Keep all the original content intact
- If there are code examples, wrap them in ```
- Keep lists as bullet points with - 
- Keep all explanations and details

Do NOT summarize or shorten the content. Just reformat for Markdown.
