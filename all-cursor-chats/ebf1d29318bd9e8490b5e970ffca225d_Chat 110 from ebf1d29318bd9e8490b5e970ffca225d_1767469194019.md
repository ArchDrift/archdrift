The engine is perfect. We have calibrated it against the 'Gold Standards.' Now, let's finish the Big 50.

1. Workspace Setup:

Create audit_targets/batch_2 and audit_targets/batch_3.

Create benchmarks/batch_2 and benchmarks/batch_3.

Add these paths to .gitignore if not already present.

2. Cloning (The Remaining 31): Batch 2: The Infrastructure Giants

facebook/react, microsoft/vscode, microsoft/TypeScript, denoland/deno, nodejs/node, sveltejs/svelte, vuejs/core, angular/angular, oven-sh/bun, solidjs/solid, remix-run/remix.

Batch 3: Apps & Ecosystem Stars

ghost/ghost, strapi/strapi, calcom/cal.com, directus/directus, n8n-io/n8n, makeplane/plane, immich-app/immich, nocodb/nocodb, nestjs/nest, ant-design/ant-design, vercel/turbo, evanw/esbuild, biomejs/biome, swc-project/swc, prettier/prettier, tailwindlabs/tailwindcss, storybookjs/storybook, tldraw/tldraw, excalidraw/excalidraw, payloadcms/payload.

3. Autonomous Audit:

Run the engine recursively on all 31 new targets.

Use the Logarithmic Floor and Library Grace thresholds we established.

Skip node_modules, dist, and test folders to save memory.

4. Data Consolidation:

Create a single FINAL_LEADERBOARD.md in the root.

Include all 50 repos (Pilot 9 + Batch 1 + Batch 2 + Batch 3).

Table columns: [Rank, Repository, Category, File Count, SII Score, Grade].

Sort by SII Score (Descending)."
