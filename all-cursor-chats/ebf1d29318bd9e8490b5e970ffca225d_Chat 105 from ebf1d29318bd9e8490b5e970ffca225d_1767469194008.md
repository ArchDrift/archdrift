The targets are ready. Now, let's run the Big 41 Audit - Batch 1.

Use the engine logic in src/ (ensure it's using the Logarithmic Floor and x2 N+1 weight from our .mdc rule).

Run a full analysis on each of the 10 repos in audit_targets/batch_1/.

For each repo, generate a SUMMARY.md and a FULL_DETAILS.md inside a new folder: results/batch_1/[repo-name]/.

Crucial: Once all 10 are done, create a master file results/batch_1/LEADERBOARD.md that ranks all 10 repos by their SII score and lists their total file counts.
