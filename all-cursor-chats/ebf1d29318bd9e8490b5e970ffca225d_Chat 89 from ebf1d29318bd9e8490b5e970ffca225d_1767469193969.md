answer any of this aplie. just answer in chat Since you want people to actually install it, just make sure your package.json and README have these three "Professional" touches:

The Global Binary: Ensure you have the bin field set in package.json so they can run it via npx without installing it globally.

The "Silent" Default: Developers hate spam. Ensure the tool only analyzes the files they care about (ignoring node_modules, .git, etc.) by default.

The "Exit Code": If you want to be "Pro," make sure the CLI returns an exit code of 0 if the score is high and 1 if it's below a certain threshold (like 50%). This lets them use it in GitHub Actions.
