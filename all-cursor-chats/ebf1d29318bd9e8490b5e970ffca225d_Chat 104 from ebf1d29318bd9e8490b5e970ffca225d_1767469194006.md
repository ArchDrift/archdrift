## unknown

want to prepare this workspace for Batch 1 of the Big 41 Audit.

Create a root-level folder named audit_targets/batch_1.

Create a shell script scripts/clone_batch_1.sh that clones the first 10 repositories: shadcn/ui, zod, pnpm, axios, create-t3-app, lucide, tanstack/query, hono, fastify, and express into that folder.

Run the script for me to pull the code down.

Once cloned, index the entire workspace so you can reference the engine and the targets in one go
