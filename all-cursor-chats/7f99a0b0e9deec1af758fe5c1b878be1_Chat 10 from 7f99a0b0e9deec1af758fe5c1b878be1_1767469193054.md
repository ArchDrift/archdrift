## unknown

We are building a hostile-minimal CLI.

Requirements:

No command may explain system behavior.

Outputs must become less informative over time, not more.

Commands that worked earlier may silently fail later.

No summaries, no success/failure messages.

History must restrict future interaction, not just state.

The CLI should feel mechanically consistent but experientially degrading.
