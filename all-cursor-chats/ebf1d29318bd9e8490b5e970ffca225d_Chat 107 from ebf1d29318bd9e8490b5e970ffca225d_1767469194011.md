## unknown

Batch 1 is done, but we have two logic errors to fix in src/analyzer.ts:

Directory Awareness: Express and Fastify got 100% because the engine ignored their /lib/ folders. Update the analyzer to include lib/, core/, and packages/ as production code sources.

Library Monolith Grace: For utility libraries (like Zod), files that primarily contain 'Type Definitions' or 'Schema Definitions' should have a higher Monolith threshold (e.g., 2,500 LOC instead of 1,500).

The 'Zod Fix': Re-run the audit on zod and express. If Zod doesn't hit >95% and Express doesn't show some debt, we aren't scanning the right files yet."
