## unknown

want the Architectural Truth, not a marketing score. Forget the logarithmic curves and the consultant grades. We are measuring Structural Decay.

Update the Logic for Absolute Objectivity:

Severity Multipliers: > * Layer Violations: 10 points (Fatal structural drift).

N+1 Queries: 4 points (Core efficiency drift).

God Classes: 1 point (Complexity drift).

The Truth Metric: Calculate the score by subtracting the Weighted Debt from the codebase's Integrity Capacity.

Strict Filtering: > * Completely ignore node_modules, dist, and tests. They are not part of the 'System Truth.'

Only count the src or core logic.

No More Labels: Remove 'Grade A' or 'Low Risk.' Replace them with a single Integrity Index (0-100%).

Direct Links: Use relative paths (e.g., src/db/client.ts). No system paths
