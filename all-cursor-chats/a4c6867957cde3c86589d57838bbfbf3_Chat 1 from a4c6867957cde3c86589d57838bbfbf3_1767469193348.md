## unknown

Set up:

A full-window <canvas> with a JS game loop using requestAnimationFrame.
​

A minimal engine with:

8–16 carriers (points) in a 2D space.

Flows that move along lines between carriers.

Internal fields: load, pressure, damage, alive for each carrier (but never shown as text).
​

Rules to implement:

Time is discrete steps; every frame or tick, increment a simulation step counter.
​

If load > capacity on a carrier: increase pressure quickly and damage on its flows.
​

If load <= capacity: decrease pressure slowly.
​

If pressure >= threshold: carrier flips to alive = false permanently.
​

No way to reduce damage; no way to revive dead carriers.
​

Rendering:

Draw carriers as small circles or squares; live ones crisp, overloaded flickery, dead ones dark/static.

Draw flows as moving particles along straight or curved lines between carriers; more damage → more jitter, noise, trail “scar” pixels.

No text, no HUD, no labels.
