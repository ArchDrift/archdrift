## unknown

We are finishing the Final 50 Audit.

1. Target Cleanup: We are replacing the 4 'N/A' results (Deno, Ghost, Ant-Design, Fastify) with new, pure TS/JS targets to reach a verified 'Big 50' leaderboard.

2. New Targets to Clone:

trpc/trpc

appwrite/appwrite

cypress-io/cypress

vitejs/vite

prisma/prisma

microsoft/playwright

elastic/kibana (The ultimate 'Application' stress test)

grafana/grafana

lodash/lodash (The ultimate 'Clean Library' benchmark)

3. Execution:

Clone these into audit_targets/final_push/.

Run the audit using the Logarithmic Floor and Library Grace rules.

Consolidate these new results with the existing Batch 1, 2, and 3 valid data.

4. Final Output:

Update FINAL_LEADERBOARD.md to show 50 Valid Repositories.

Ensure the 'N/A' repos are moved to a small 'Appendix' table at the bottom.
