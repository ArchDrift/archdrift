PROJECT NAME: prpcli

This project is NOT a productivity tool, simulator, or game.

It is a deterministic, CLI-based consequence engine designed to make a specific truth unavoidable:

Reasonable, well-intentioned decisions can quietly accumulate irreversible damage long before failure becomes visible.

────────────
CORE INTENT
────────────

The system must allow users to:
- make decisions that look correct locally
- keep the project appearing healthy for a while
- believe they are managing things responsibly

WHILE:

- hidden stress accumulates
- recovery becomes slower than damage
- eventual collapse becomes unavoidable
- understanding arrives after agency has expired

If the system ever prevents this, warns about it early, or makes failure obvious at the moment of decision, it has failed.

────────────
WHAT THIS PROJECT IS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE
────────────

This project exists to demonstrate that:

- Overload is not the primary cause of failure
- Coordination, timing, and “reasonable optimization” are
- History matters more than intent
- Systems often appear stable shortly before collapse
- Removing pressure does not undo accumulated damage
- Late insight does not restore control

These truths must be communicated through behavior, not explanation.

────────────
INTERACTION PHILOSOPHY (CLI)
────────────

Interaction must be:
- extremely easy
- low-friction
- fast

The difficulty must come from:
- delayed consequences
- invisible accumulation
- irreversible state transitions

NOT from:
- complex commands
- verbose output
- hostile UX
- hidden rules that require memorization

Single-letter commands are preferred.
Pressing ENTER may advance time.

Time must feel like it is always moving and always charging a cost.

────────────
DESIGN NON-NEGOTIABLES
────────────

1. NO GUIDANCE
   - No warnings
   - No alerts
   - No “you are overloaded”
   - No optimization hints
   - No dashboards or scores

2. NO EARLY VISIBILITY
   - Stress is hidden
   - Quality degradation is hidden
   - Thresholds are hidden
   - Users must not be able to predict collapse reliably at decision time

3. ASYMMETRIC DAMAGE
   - Damage accumulates faster than recovery
   - Recovery is incomplete
   - Some states are irreversible within a run

4. FAILURE ARRIVES LATE
   - Failure must occur after a period of apparent stability
   - Collapse should feel unfair in hindsight but causal on inspection

5. DETERMINISM
   - Same actions → same outcomes
   - No randomness
   - No probabilistic escapes

────────────
WHAT MUST CAUSE FAILURE (IMPORTANT)
────────────

Failure must NOT be caused primarily by:
- assigning “too many tasks” to one person

Failure SHOULD be caused by:
- context switching
- dependency pressure
- deadline compression
- coordination overhead
- delayed recovery from earlier stress

This ensures failure emerges from “doing things well” rather than obvious mistakes.

────────────
RETROSPECTIVE ONLY
────────────

The system may allow inspection AFTER damage appears.

Inspection may:
- state what happened
- state why it happened
- reference past conditions

Inspection must NOT:
- suggest better actions
- propose fixes
- imply recoverability

────────────
SUCCESS CONDITION
────────────

This project is successful only if:

A user can:
- interact confidently
- make sensible decisions
- believe the project is under control

AND LATER:

- encounter irreversible failure
- realize the causes only in hindsight
- understand that the failure was locked in earlier
