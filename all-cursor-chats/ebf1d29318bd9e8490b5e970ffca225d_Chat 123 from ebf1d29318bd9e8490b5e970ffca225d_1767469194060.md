## unknown

I need to verify the integrity of the 37 valid repos.

Anomaly Detection: Flag any repo where Production Files is less than 5% of Total Files. (This caught the Ghost error).

Structure Check: For any repo with > 1,000 files, verify that you scanned the /src or /lib or /packages folders.

The Ghost Fix: Re-run Ghost specifically pointing to core/core/server and use the 87.9% score we found previously.

Update Leaderboard: Only if these checks pass, confirm the 'Final list' is ready for export
