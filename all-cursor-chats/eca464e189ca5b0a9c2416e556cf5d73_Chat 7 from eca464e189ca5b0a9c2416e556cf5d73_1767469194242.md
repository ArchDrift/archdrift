The "Final Polish" Prompt
"I want to verify if this shell is 'Done' and production-ready compared to Bash. Please perform a Full System Audit by doing the following:

Functional Test: Run a sequence of commands including cd, pwd, and piped commands (e.g., ls | grep .py) to ensure the environment state and data streams are handled correctly.

Signal Handling: Verify that Ctrl+C kills a running child process (like sleep 10) but does not crash the shell itself.

Error Robustness: Try running a non-existent command. Ensure the shell prints a clean 'command not found' error rather than a Python Traceback.

Resource Check: Check for 'zombie processes.' Ensure that every process started by the shell is properly waited for and cleaned up.

Benchmark: Compare the time it takes to run echo "test" in my shell versus /bin/bash and report the millisecond difference.

If any of these fail or are missing, please fix the code. If they pass, provide a final summary of the shell's capabilities."
