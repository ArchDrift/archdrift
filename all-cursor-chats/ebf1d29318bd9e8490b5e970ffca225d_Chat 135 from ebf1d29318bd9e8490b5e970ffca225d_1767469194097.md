## unknown

answer all these questions in chat only: 1. What is the exact structure of the DriftGuard repo root folder? List ALL files/folders (package.json, src/, scripts/, etc.)

2. Show me the contents of package.json (especially name, version, repository field, contributes, activationEvents, main)

3. Is this packaged as a VS Code extension? What does `npm run package` or `vsce package` produce? Is there a .vsix file?

4. What do the scripts/ folder files do (batch_analyze_2_3.js etc.)? Are they standalone Node.js scripts or extension dependencies?

5. Does the codebase have any Pro/freemium logic already (API keys, limits, Stripe)? Or is it all free/local only?
