# Project Under Pressure

Deterministic simulation engine for modeling team and work quality degradation under sustained workload pressure.

## Features

- **Deterministic behavior**: Identical inputs always produce identical outputs
- **Asymmetric stress dynamics**: Accumulation (fast) vs decay (slow)
- **Silent quality degradation**: Risk builds invisibly during overload periods
- **Irreversible burnout**: State transitions without recovery mechanics
- **Complete state serialization**: Full system restore without loss of meaning

## Validation

Engine behavior validated through comprehensive deterministic tests:

npm test

text

**Test suite covers:**
- Time advancement (monotonic, irreversible)
- Stress accumulation and asymmetric decay rates
- Burnout state transitions and persistence
- Quality risk accumulation during pressure
- Task blocking and dependency resolution
- State serialization/restoration integrity

## Architecture

**Current: Stage 1 (Core Engine)**

Pure simulation logic with no UI dependencies. Engine operates on minimal state (tasks, people, time) with explicit consequence propagation rules.

See `/docs` for complete architectural specification.

## Installation

npm install
npm run build
node dist/test.js
