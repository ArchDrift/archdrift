## unknown

I have DriftGuard installed and active in this Cursor window.
I want to confirm its current behavior against the examples from my Ghost tuning report, not just assume it’s missing things.

For each of these files/patterns, do the following:

Open the file.

Tell me whether DriftGuard shows any diagnostics in the file (Problems panel entries, squiggles, status bar).

For the specific pattern I mention, say explicitly: “Flagged by DriftGuard” or “Not flagged by DriftGuard”.

Files / patterns to check:

ghost/core/core/server/services/members/members-api/repositories/MemberRepository.js (God Class + N+1 loops, e.g., productsToAdd loop around lines 622–635).

ghost/core/core/server/services/stats/PostsStatsService.js (God Class candidate).

apps/activitypub/src/hooks/use-activity-pub-queries.ts (very large hooks file).

apps/shade/src/components/ui/filters.tsx (very large React component).

ghost/core/core/server/services/email-analytics/EmailAnalyticsService.js (N+1 loops around aggregateEmailStats and aggregateMemberStats).

ghost/core/core/server/data/migrations/versions/5.0/2022-05-21-00-00-regenerate-posts-html.js (migration N+1 loop we may want to ignore).

ghost/core/core/server/services/email-service/EmailServiceWrapper.js (service importing from ../../api/endpoints/.../serializers/.../url).

ghost/core/core/server/lib/lexical.js (lib importing ../api/endpoints/utils/serializers/output/posts).

For each one, summarize in a tiny table like:
| File | Pattern | DG warning? | Your judgment (TP / FN / OK) |

Only after you’ve gone through all of them and confirmed DG’s current behavior, I’ll take your summary and apply it to adjust DriftGuard’s analyzer in the extension project.
