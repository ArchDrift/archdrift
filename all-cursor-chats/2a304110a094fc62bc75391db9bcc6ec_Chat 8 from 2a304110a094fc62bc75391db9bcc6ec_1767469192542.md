## unknown

he pilot scores are too high (all A/S). Let's make the SII calculation more 'opinionated' for the launch:

Increase Penalties: Make a 'God Class' (>1500 lines) take 5% off the score instead of 1%.

N+1 Severity: Any detected N+1 query should be a major architectural red flag—drop the score by 3% per instance.

Complexity Floor: Only calculate the score for files with more than 50 lines of code. This stops 'empty' files from artificially boosting the average.

Recalculate: Run the pilot audit again with these 'Strict Mode' settin
