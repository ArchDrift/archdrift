Update the FINAL_LEADERBOARD.md to account for multi-language projects.

For esbuild (Batch 3) and Biome (Batch 3):

Add Tag: Change the Notes column to: [Systems Tool - TS Wrapper Only].

Add Context: In the detailed breakdown for these repos, add a 'Scope Note': 'Analysis limited to TypeScript/JavaScript glue code. Core logic (Go/Rust) is outside current audit scope.'

Recalculate Averages: Ensure these 'Wrapper-only' repos still count towards the average, but their low file count is now clearly explained.

For N/A Repos: > Move them to a separate 'Out of Scope / Non-JS Core' table at the bottom to keep the main leaderboard clean.
