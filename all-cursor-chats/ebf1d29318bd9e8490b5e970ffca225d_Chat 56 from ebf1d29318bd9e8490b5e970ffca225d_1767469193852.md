## unknown

Now use the IssueSummary and rawIssues to create a new command driftguard.generateReport.

Requirements:

Header: 🛡️ DriftGuard Architecture Audit.

Drift Score: Use a weighted penalty: Max(0, 100 - (totalIssues * 2)). (This is a simpler v0.4 proxy for health).

Pattern Breakdown: A Markdown table showing: Pattern Name | Count | Severity.

Top Offenders (Interactivity): List the top 5 files by issue count. Crucial: Format the file paths as clickable VS Code links so I can click the report to jump to the code. (e.g., [path/to/file.ts:line](file:///path/to/file.ts)).

Footer: 'Generated by DriftGuard v0.4 • [Stop the AI Slop]'.

Technical Implementation:

When triggered, generate the string and open it in a new unsaved Markdown document (vscode.workspace.openTextDocument with language: 'markdown').

Do not attempt to calculate total lines of code across the workspace (to avoid FS performance issues); stick to the data already in IssueSummary.

Keep it strictly GitHub-flavored markdown."
