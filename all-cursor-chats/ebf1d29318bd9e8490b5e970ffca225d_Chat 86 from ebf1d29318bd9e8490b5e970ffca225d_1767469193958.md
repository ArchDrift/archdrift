## unknown

efine the God Class detection and math:

Change the threshold: Only flag files as God Classes if they exceed 800 LOC.

Tiered Weighting: > - 801 - 1,500 LOC = 1 point (Label: Large Class)

1,501+ LOC = 5 points (Label: Monolith)

SII Update: Ensure these new weights are used in the TotalWeightedDebt calculation.

Exclusions: Ensure node_modules, dist, and min.js files are strictly ignored to prevent false 'Monolith' flags."
