DriftGuard is giving itself a 100% score but ignoring its own violations. We need to fix the engine and reporting logic:

Fix Reporting Templates: In the SUMMARY.md generator, if the score is 100%, the 'Expert Diagnosis' should reflect a 'Perfect Architecture' instead of showing **Unknown** placeholders.

Audit Logic Check: Ensure the pilot-audit.ts is not accidentally excluding its own source files during the audit. If a file contains a flagged pattern (like the N+1 query in analyzer.test.js), it must appear in FULL_DETAILS.md, even if the final score is high.

Debug the 100%: Why is the N+1 query in analyzer.test.js (seen in the screenshot) not being counted in the pilot audit? If it’s because it’s a .test.js file, we need to decide: should we audit our own tests for drift?"
