In charts.html, update only the first chart (Asymmetry – Damage vs Recovery) to look more like a research figure, without changing any data or fetch logic.

Visual changes:

Use a darker charcoal background for the chart area and remove bold gridlines (make them very faint or invisible).

Make the accumulation (damage) line a muted deep red, slightly thicker, with small circular markers at each point.

Make the recovery line a muted steel blue, same thickness, also with markers.

Add a faint translucent red vertical band behind the overload steps and a faint blue vertical band behind the recovery steps, using the existing step ranges from the data.

Add a thin horizontal dashed line near the top of the current Y range labeled "Threshold" (no numeric value, just the label).

Use a clean sans-serif font for all axis labels and the legend, slightly smaller than default.

Remove the chart title from inside the canvas if present; keep the title only in HTML above the canvas.

Do not modify the second chart or any JavaScript related to data loading; only adjust the Chart.js options and datasets styling for the first chart.
