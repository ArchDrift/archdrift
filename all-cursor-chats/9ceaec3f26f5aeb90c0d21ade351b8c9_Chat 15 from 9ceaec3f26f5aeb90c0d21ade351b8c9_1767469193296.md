Add a small helper in test.ts that, when tests run, writes minimal JSON files under a new chart-data folder for visualization.

Requirements:

Helper function writeChartData(name, payload) that ensures chart-data/ exists (relative to compiled JS) and writes prettified JSON.

For TEST 1 (ASYMMETRY), after you already compute the accumulation and decay sequences, call writeChartData('asymmetry', { accumulation: { steps: [...], stress: [...] }, decay: { steps: [...], stress: [...] } }) using the actual arrays used in the test.

For TEST 6 (LOOKS HEALTHY WHILE DYING), after you know the month numbers and when collapse happens, call writeChartData('looks-healthy', { months: [...], status: [...] }) where status is an array of strings like 'active' for months 1–9 and 'collapsed' at the collapse month.

Make sure this data is written in both PRODUCTION and DEBUG modes (so a plain node dist/test.js will create the files).

Don’t change the existing test behavior or outputs, just add these writes.
