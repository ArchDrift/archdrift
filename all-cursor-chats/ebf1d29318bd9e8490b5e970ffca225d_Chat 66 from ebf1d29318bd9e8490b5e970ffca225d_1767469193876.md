remove "stop the ai slop" from reports. here grey, change to white. and i am only getting one audit file but then never the full list. 
Instead of one file, have DriftGuard generate a folder called .driftguard/audits/ (or just two separate buffers).

File 1: SUMMARY.md (The "Executive Verdict" we just polished).

File 2: FULL_DETAILS.md (The "Raw Evidence").

What goes in FULL_DETAILS.md: Instead of a summary, this is a line-by-line breakdown of every single violation found in the scan.
