## unknown

create 6 new tests that prove these claims:

TEST 1 - ASYMMETRY
Prove damage accumulates 5x faster than healing.
- Start Alice at stress 0, overload with 3 tasks
- Run 10 steps, print stress each step
- Remove overload, run 50 steps, print every 5 steps
- Calculate accumulation vs decay ratio

TEST 2 - IRREVERSIBILITY
Prove burnout is permanent.
- Start Bob at stress 45, overload
- Run 1 step to trigger burnout
- Remove all tasks, run 100 steps
- Print every 20 steps showing burnout persists

TEST 3 - SILENCE
Prove quality degrades silently.
- Overload Charlie with 3 tasks
- Run 8 steps, print qualityRisk each step
- Mark task as completed
- Show qualityRisk persists after completion

TEST 4 - PERSISTENCE
Prove stress remains after pressure removed.
- Overload Dana for 6 steps (stress→30)
- Remove overload
- Show stress decays slowly (30 steps to reach 0)
- Print every 5 steps

TEST 5 - RESISTANCE
Prove late intervention is insufficient.
- Overload Eve, keep Frank normal
- Run 9 steps (Eve stress→45)
- Reassign task from Eve to Frank (intervention)
- Run 3 more steps
- Show Eve burns out anyway, Frank now overloaded

TEST 6 - LOOKS HEALTHY WHILE DYING
Prove balanced systems collapse.
- 3 people, 3 tasks each (evenly distributed)
- Run 9 steps, print all stress levels each step
- Show all reach stress 45 (appears balanced)
- Run 1 more step, all burn out simultaneously

For all tests:
- Show step-by-step progression (loop and print each step)
- Use section headers (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)
- Print actual computed values, not hardcoded text
- Let numbers demonstrate the principles
- Minimal prose, data speaks for itself
