🚨 Critical Red Flag: "N/A" Repos in Appendix (The "Lazy" Signal)
Issue: You listed Ghost, Fastify, Ant Design, Grafana, Kibana as "N/A - Language Mismatch."

Why it hurts: These ARE huge JS/TS projects.

Ghost: Pure Node.js.

Fastify: Pure JS.

Ant Design: Massive React/TS library.

Grafana/Kibana: Massive TS codebases.

The "Lazy" Signal: If your tool says "Ghost = N/A", a user thinks: "Does this tool not work on JS files? Or did it just fail to find the src folder?"

Fix: Do not publish the Appendix.

Remove the "Appendix: Out of Scope Repositories" section entirely.

Why? Nobody cares about what you didn't scan. Listing them only invites questions about why they failed. Just show the 43 valid successes. It looks cleaner and more confident.

⚠️ Moderate Red Flag: The "Systems Tool" Scores (Biome/Esbuild)
Issue: You explicitly flagged esbuild and biome as "Wrapper Only" (Good!), but they still have low scores (75% and 81%) despite having almost no debt (Weighted Debt = 5).

The Math Weirdness:

esbuild: 5 Weighted Debt / 19 files = 75.4%?

vue: 5 Weighted Debt / 277 files = 98.2%?

The HN Question: "Why does Esbuild (5 debt) get a C+, but Vue (5 debt) gets an A+?"

The Answer (Likely): Your formula penalizes small file counts heavily if there's any debt. (5 debt on 19 files is a high "debt per file" ratio).

Fix: Add a note in the "Methodology" or "Notes" column for small repos: "Score sensitive to debt-per-file ratio in small wrappers." Or, honestly, drop them. They confuse the ranking more than they help. Comparing a 19-file wrapper to Cal.com is noise.

⚠️ Moderate Red Flag: Directus vs Strapi (The Controversy)
Issue: directus is F (46%) vs strapi B+ (89%).

Why it's good: Controversy!

Why it's risky: Directus is huge. If that 3137 debt is mostly "Layer Violations," make sure it's not flagging valid patterns (e.g., a massive extensions folder).

Action: Keep it. This is your headline. "Directus (46%) vs Strapi (89%) - The Headless CMS Architecture Gap." Just be ready to defend why (e.g., "Directus has 300+ layer violations in core modules").

✅ The "League" Formatting (Do this!)
The current big table is readable, but "Leagues" tells a better story.

Suggestion: Re-order the final Markdown into 3 distinct tables:

"The Heavyweights" (Apps & Frameworks > 1000 files)

The real test of architectural endurance.

Storybook (99%), Angular (97%), Nest (95%), VS Code (91%), Strapi (89%), Cal.com (84%), Directus (46%).

"The Foundations" (Libraries & Tools)

Core infrastructure that must remain pure.

Axios, Express, Lucide, Prettier, Zod, tRPC (all 95-100%).

"The Wrappers" (System Tools)

Glue code analysis only.

Biome, Esbuild.

Why?

It prevents the "Axios vs Cal.com" comparison.

It highlights Storybook as the "King of Heavyweights" (which is impressive).

It spotlights Directus as the "Fallen Giant" without making it look like it's losing to Axios.

🧹 Final Scrub Checklist
DELETE the "Appendix: Out of Scope Repositories" section.

DELETE lodash (Rank 42). 67% on 13 files? It looks like the same "small repo math bug" as esbuild. It adds nothing.

RENAME "Final Push" batch to something generic like "Batch 4" or just merge them. "Final Push" sounds like internal project management speak.

CHECK node (Rank 28). 93% on 648 files. Ensure you scanned the JS lib folder, not C++ headers. If confirmed, it's a great stat.
