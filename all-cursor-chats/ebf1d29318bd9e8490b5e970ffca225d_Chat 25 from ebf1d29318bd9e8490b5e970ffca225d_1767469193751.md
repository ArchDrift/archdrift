does any of this app;lies. answer before u do: Deep Nesting: The file is at core/core/server/lib/lexical.js. Ensure the detectLayer logic searches for the folder name /lib/ anywhere in the path, not just at the start.

Dynamic Requires: The violation in lexical.js happens inside a function using require(). Ensure the scanner looks for require calls throughout the whole file, not just import statements at the top.

Layer Mapping: Confirm that any file containing /lib/ in its path is correctly assigned to the 'lib' layer."
