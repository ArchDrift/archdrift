## unknown

he scores collapsed to 0% because the penalties are accumulating linearly. We need to fix the $SII$ math to be Proportional. Please update the calculateSII function in ./engine:Density over Count: Instead of Score - (Count * 5%), use a ratio: (Total Production Files - Violation Count) / Total Production Files.Weighted Ratio: If we want God Classes to hurt more, weight that specific count. For example: Score = 100 - ((GodClassCount * 5 + N1Count * 3) / TotalFiles * 100).Logarithmic Floor: Ensure a score can never actually hit 0% unless every single file is a violation. A 'bad' high-scale repo should land between 40% and 60%, not 0%.Recalculate: Run the pilot audit again
