## unknown

In this repo, create a new file n1-test.js at the root (or under src/ if that’s more natural).

In that file, write a small async function that clearly has an N+1 DB/API pattern, for example:

An array of userIds.

A for loop (or forEach) over userIds.

Inside the loop, an await call to db.users.findOne(...) or await axios.get(...).

Make it valid JavaScript with an exported function so the file looks realistic.
