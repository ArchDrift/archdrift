## unknown

confirm?

We are in the driftguard VS Code extension project.
Files that already exist and should be kept:

package.json

tsconfig.json

src/extension.ts

src/analyzer.ts

.vscode/launch.json

.vscode/tasks.json

.vscodeignore

.gitignore

README.md

Do NOT change or delete these. We are going to add automated tests for the analyzer logic only.
