Recursion: Ensure the production file crawler looks deeply into subdirectories (e.g., lib/**/*.js).

Extensions: Ensure we are scanning .js, .mjs, .ts, and .tsx. (Express is .js, Zod is .ts).

The 'Express' Stress Test: Re-scan express. If it still shows 0 violations, look at lib/router/index.js specifically. Does the engine see the complexity there?

Batch 2 Readiness: Once Express shows at least some violations (likely N+1s in the middleware logic), we are officially ready for the remaining 31 repos.
