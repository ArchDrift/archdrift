The Big 41 Audit results are in, but we have Data Drift. Let's refine the FINAL_LEADERBOARD.md before we finalize:

Zero-File Filter: Any repository with 0 Production Files must be marked as 'N/A - Language Mismatch' or 'RE-SCAN REQUIRED'. It cannot stay at 100%. (Check Deno, Ghost, and Ant-Design specifically).

The esbuild Adjustment: If esbuild has a low score, it's because of the Optimization Penalty. Add a 'Systems Tool' tag to it and increase the God Class threshold for files in esbuild to 5,000 LOC (it's a performance-first tool).

The 'Strapi' Benchmark: Ensure Strapi and Directus both show their 'Application' debt (N+1s and God Classes). This makes our 'Clean Framework' scores (like Express/Axios) look much more meaningful.

Recalculate Averages: Only include repos with Production Files > 0 in the final averages.
