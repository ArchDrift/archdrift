Leaderboard Redesign (Non-Preachy, Signal-First)
Design goal

Make it hard to misread, without telling people how to think.

That means:

No ranks

No grades

No “Top / Bottom”

No apology text

Let the structure speak

1. Replace “Leaderboard” with Structural Landscape
❌ Old mental model

Who’s best?

✅ New mental model

What shapes exist?

2. Primary table: Structural Profiles (Unordered)

Alphabetical inside clusters.
No numbers larger than humans can emotionally abuse.

Heavyweight Applications & Frameworks
Structural Profile	Repositories	Dominant Signal
Layered & Stable	angular, pnpm, svelte, storybook	Boundaries hold at scale
Layered, High-Velocity	cypress, nest, payload, tldraw	Minor leakage under speed
Entropic at Scale	node, react, n8n, vite	Size pressure, not neglect
Boundary-Stressed	calcom, prisma, strapi	Cross-layer erosion
Boundary-Free	directus	Architectural rules absent or unenforced

No one can say “Angular beat React” anymore — the table literally doesn’t allow it.

3. Repo card replaces rank

When a user clicks a repo, they see a structural card, not a score.

Example: strapi

Architecture Shape
→ Layered, Boundary-Stressed

Violation Density
→ Medium–High

Violation Composition

Layer Violations   ████████░░
N+1 Queries        █████░░░░░
God Monoliths      █░░░░░░░░░


Interpretation (one line, neutral)

Boundaries exist but are frequently bypassed in production paths.
4. Keep SII — just demote it visually

SII stays numeric but secondary.

Instead of:
SII: 89.3% (B+)


Use:

Structural Integrity Index: 89.3


No percent sign

No grade

Same font weight as file counts

Shown below the profile, not above5. Replace “Top Performers” with Reference Cases

Not preachy, just factual exemplars.

Reference Architectures
Repo	Why it’s referenced
storybook	Large surface area with strong modular isolation
angular	Strict layering sustained over time
typescript	Demonstrates entropy effects at extreme scale
directus	Illustrates unchecked cross-layer coupling

This frames them as examples, not winners or losers.

6. Visual cue: axis-based overview (quiet but powerful)

If you use a graphic anywhere, use two axes, not a list.

X-axis: Boundary Enforcement

Y-axis: Scale / Velocity Pressure

Repos plotted as dots.

What happens:

People stop thinking “higher is better”

They start thinking “different stresses”

No explanation text needed — the geometry does the work.7. Keep categories — but make them structural, not size-based

Rename leagues quietly:

Frameworks & Runtimes

Developer Tooling

Application Platforms

System Wrappers

Never:

“Heavyweights”

“Foundations”

Anything that implies hierarchy“

ArchDrift maps architectural stress patterns across codebases

rename ssi to Architectural Drift Pressure (ADP)

1. Remove %
❌ 91.6%
✅ 91.6

2. Remove grades forever

No A+, B, etc.
Those will be misused.

3. Pair number with band
Structural Stability Signal: 91.6
Band: Stable


The band does the interpretation work.
