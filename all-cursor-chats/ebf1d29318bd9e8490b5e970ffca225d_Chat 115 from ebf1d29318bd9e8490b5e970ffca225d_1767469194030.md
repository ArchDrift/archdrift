## unknown

Context: I am resuming the "Big 41 Audit." We have already completed Batch 1.

Current Status:

Engine: The analyzer logic is in @src/analyzer.ts.

Calibration: We tuned the engine for "Library Monolith Grace" (2,500 LOC for types/schemas) and "Deep Recursion" for folders like /lib/ and /core/.

Completed: Batch 1 is done. Results are in @benchmarks/batch_1/.

Task: Proceed with Batch 2 and 3 of the audit.

Setup: Ensure audit_targets/batch_2 and audit_targets/batch_3 folders exist.

Targets: Refer to the list in @WORKSPACE_INDEX.md (or the previous list I gave you) for the 31 remaining repos like facebook/react, microsoft/vscode, etc.

Protocol: > - Clone the repos into their respective batch folders.

Run the audit using the established rules.

Skip node_modules, dist, and test to save memory.

Output results to benchmarks/batch_2/ and benchmarks/batch_3/.

Final Goal: Generate a FINAL_LEADERBOARD.md consolidating all 50 repositories (Pilot 9 + Batches 1-3).

Important: Keep terminal output brief to avoid serialization errors. Only print a one-line summary per repo (e.g., "React: 82% - Done").
