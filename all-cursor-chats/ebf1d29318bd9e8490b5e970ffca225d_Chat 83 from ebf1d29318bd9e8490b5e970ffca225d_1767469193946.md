## unknown

The links in SUMMARY.md are currently broken because of path normalization issues on Windows. Please fix this and enhance the interactivity with these 3 steps:

1. Fix the Summary-to-Detail Link: Since SUMMARY.md and FULL_DETAILS.md are in the same folder, change the link at the bottom to a simple: [View Full Details →](FULL_DETAILS.md). Do not use absolute or complex relative paths.

2. Interactive Top Offenders: For the 'Top Offenders' list, convert the file paths into clickable links that Cursor can open.

Format: 1. [path/to/file.js](path/to/file.js) — XX pts

Constraint: Ensure these paths are relative to the project root (e.g., starting with ghost/... or src/...), not system-absolute paths. Use path.relative(process.cwd(), filePath) to ensure consistency.

3. Standardize Slash Direction: Use forward slashes / for all links inside the Markdown files, as Markdown engines (and Cursor) recognize these as universal URIs, even on Windows. Use filePath.split(path.sep).join('/') to sanitize them."
