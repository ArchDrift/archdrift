## unknown

I want a single JavaScript file named test-godclass.js in this folder.

Requirements:

Around 600–800 lines of realistic backend-style code.

Mix of route handlers, services, utilities, and some comments.

No need to actually run; it just needs to be syntactically valid.

Don’t worry about architecture – it should feel like one big, messy file to simulate a “God class.”

Please create that file directly in the current workspace.
