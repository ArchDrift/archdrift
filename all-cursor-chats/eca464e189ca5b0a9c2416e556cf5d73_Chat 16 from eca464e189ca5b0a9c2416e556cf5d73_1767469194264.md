## unknown

Update the existing README.md surgically, without changing structure or removing sections.

Required changes:

Replace the opening description to remove “POSIX-compliant” and “production-ready”. Use neutral, accurate wording that describes PyShell as an interactive shell implemented in Python.

Keep the feature comparison table, but ensure it reflects that background execution (&) and signal handling (Ctrl+C) are fully supported (both marked ✅).

Update the “Completeness” line to: 17/20 core interactive shell features (85%).

Reword the “Conditional Execution Flow” intro to describe explicit exit-code–based conditional execution evaluated in-process, not “professional scripting”.

In the Performance section, remove all speed multipliers (e.g., “21,000x faster”) but keep absolute timing measurements. Emphasize in-process execution instead of relative claims.

Constraints:

Do NOT add new features or claims.

Do NOT say “POSIX-compliant” or “production-ready”.

Do NOT change code examples, tables, or section order unless explicitly required above.

Preserve existing benchmarks, tests, and file references.

The goal is to make the README strictly accurate, technically credible, and conservative in claims while keeping its current structure.
