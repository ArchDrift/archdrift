coring: Abandon the logarithmic formula. Use Violation Density (Total Issues / (Total LOC / 1000)). Use these tiers:

< 2 issues/KLoC = A

2-5 = B

5-10 = C

10-20 = D

20 = F

Contextual Awareness: Do not count violations in tests/, dist/, or node_modules/ toward the score. Only 'Production Code' matters for the health grade.

The 'Consultant' Report: > - Remove all absolute file:/// paths. Use Relative Paths from the project root.

Add a 'Risk Assessment' section at the top that translates the Grade into 'Future Maintenance Liability' (e.g., Grade F = High Risk, Grade A = Low Risk)."
