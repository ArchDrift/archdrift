## unknown

the Ghost repo score of 92 feels too high given the critical violations found. We need to make the scoring more aggressive by weighting the violations. Update the calculation logic:

Weighted Density: Don't just count issues. Use a 'Weighted Penalty' system:

Layer Violations (🔴): Multiply by 5 (These are structural failures).

N+1 Queries (🟡): Multiply by 3 (These are performance killers).

God Classes (🟡): Multiply by 1 (These are just maintenance debt).

Recalculate: Use the sum of these weighted points divided by the LOC to get the new density.

Clean up Offenders: Again, REMOVE all test files from the 'Top Offenders' list. I only want to see the production files that are actually dragging the score down
