## unknown

tell me the same about this: Here’s everything that’s been suggested as **next updates / improvements** for DriftGuard, grouped so you can see the roadmap cleanly.

## 1. Tuning & coverage on real repos

- Run DriftGuard on 2–3 real Node/TS backends (clean and messy) and tune **noise vs signal**.[1][2]
- Adjust:
  - God Class threshold and ignore folders like `config/`, `migrations/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, generated code.  
  - N+1 patterns and layer rules based on obvious false positives from those repos.[3][1]
- Goal: feel proud showing a Workspace Report screenshot for a real repo.[4][5]

## 2. Workspace Report (team-level view)

- Add **“DriftGuard: Workspace Report”** command that:  
  - Scans supported files in workspace.  
  - Runs God Class, N+1, and layer checks.  
  - Produces summary (counts, top offenders) in an Output channel + `DRIFTGUARD_REPORT.md`.[6][5]
- This is Phase 2 / v0.3, turning it from “just a linter” into an **architecture snapshot tool** for tech leads.[7][6]

## 3. Smarter rules & guidance

- Deepen **N+1**:
  - Recognize more loop/query shapes, nested loops, and suggest batching/preloading ideas (Prosopite/Bullet-style hints).[8][9]
- Improve **layer detection** heuristics (only when at least two layer roots detected; avoid dumb folder assumptions).[10][6]
- Add better **messages / docs links** so each diagnostic has a short explanation and optional “learn more” link.[9][1]

## 4. Vibecoder / Cursor-aware future work

- Detect **“AI paste seams”**: style shifts, unused helpers, duplicated logic that look LLM-inserted, then apply stricter checks there.[11][12]
- Add **vibecoding workflow rules**: inconsistent patterns across neighboring files, route→DB shortcuts that bypass layers, big AI refactors leaving dead code.[12][11]
- Track **AI drift hot‑spots over time**: files heavily edited in big bursts get stricter thresholds and more attention.[11]

## 5. Productization & experience

- **Tests & robustness**: Mocha-based test suite for analyzers and Workspace Report so changes don’t break behavior.[13][1]
- **Packaging & distribution**:
  - VSIX packaging + GitHub Releases.  
  - VS Code Marketplace listing with icon, banner, screenshots, and honest “early access” messaging.[14][15]
- **Roadmap / business track**:
  - Eventually: CI/PR integration, team features, maybe Pro/Cloud version; extension remains the free safety net front-end.[16][17]
