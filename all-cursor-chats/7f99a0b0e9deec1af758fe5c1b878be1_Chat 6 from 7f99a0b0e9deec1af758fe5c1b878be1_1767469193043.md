# UI REDESIGN DIRECTIVE: FROM DASHBOARD TO EMERGENCE

Status: Authoritative Correction
Purpose: Restore architectural integrity by eliminating dashboard drift and replacing with spatial emergence patterns

---

## CURRENT STATE VIOLATIONS

### What Exists Now (INCORRECT):
1. **Event logs with explanatory text** ("person-2 became overloaded. Cause: Workload 3 exceeded capacity 2")
2. **Numeric metrics exposed** (Workload: 0/2, Stress: 50, Quality Risk: 24)
3. **Aggregate dashboards** (0/4 completed, BLOCKED 3, BURNED OUT 1)
4. **Causal analysis with pedagogical explanations** (Contributing factors, Total overload duration)
5. **Reset buttons** (violates irreversibility)
6. **List-based layout** (resembles Jira/Asana)

### Why This Failed:
- Built a **report interface** instead of a **simulation view**
- Explains mechanics instead of showing consequence propagation
- Text-heavy where it must be visually emergent
- Teaches optimization instead of demonstrating irreversibility

**This is Failure Mode 7 (Event Narrative) + Failure Mode 1 (Metrics Collapse) + Failure Mode 5 (Dashboard Drift)** [File 5, E.4]

---

## TARGET STATE: SPATIAL EMERGENCE

### Core Principle:
**"You discover the rules by watching cells change state, not by reading what caused them to change."**

The UI must show consequence propagation through visual state changes in a spatial field, with zero explanatory text during execution.

---

## STAGE 2-3: MAIN SIMULATION VIEW

### Layout Structure:

**Spatial Field (replaces lists):**
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ │
│ [Person Node]───────[Task Entity] │
│ │ │
│ │ │
│ └───[Task Entity]───→[Task Entity] │
│ │
│ [Person Node] │
│ │ │
│ └───[Task Entity] │
│ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
[Advance Time Button]

text

**Not lists. Not panels. A spatial field where entities exist and interact.**

### Entity Representation:

**People (Nodes):**
- **Visual form**: Circular nodes, sized consistently
- **Default state (normal)**: Neutral color (gray/blue), solid fill, no motion
- **Overloaded state**: Warmer color (orange/amber), subtle pulse/vibration, increased glow
- **Burned out state**: Muted/dark (charcoal), no motion (frozen), desaturated, reduced opacity
- **NO text labels for state** ("normal", "overloaded")
- **NO numeric indicators** (workload count, stress level)
- **Name visible**: Person name only (Alice, Bob) - from Display Adapter

**Tasks (Entities):**
- **Visual form**: Rectangular or rounded-rect entities
- **Pending state**: Outline only, dim, no activity
- **In Progress state**: Solid fill, active state, connected to person node via line
- **Blocked state**: Disconnected from person, grayed out, visual "stall"
- **Completed state**: Solid but quieter, no celebration
- **Quality degradation**: Subtle blur, noise texture, desaturation increases with quality risk
- **NO status labels** ("In Progress", "Blocked")
- **NO quality risk numbers**
- **Task name visible**: Brief label (Design API, Auth, Tests)

**Dependencies (Connections):**
- Visible as lines/arrows between tasks
- Dim when inactive
- Active when task is in progress
- Severed/dashed when blocked

**Workload Representation:**
- **Visual**: Lines connecting active tasks to person nodes
- **Overload visible through**: Multiple lines converging, person node color/motion shift
- **NOT shown as**: "3/2" or "workload count"

**Stress/Burnout Representation:**
- **Stress accumulation**: Increasing visual intensity (pulse frequency, glow strength)
- **Burnout transition**: Sudden state flip - node goes dark/frozen
- **NOT shown as**: Stress meter, percentage, countdown

### Interaction (Stage 3):

**Reassignment:**
- Click task → click new person
- Visual: connection line shifts
- NO confirmation dialogs
- NO explanatory feedback

**Time Control:**
- Single "Advance Time" button
- Each click advances 1 step
- Current time step shown minimally ("Time: 12")
- NO auto-play, NO variable speed, NO pause-with-benefit

---

## VISUAL EMERGENCE PATTERNS TO ENABLE

### What Observer Should See (without text):

**Overload spreading:**
- Person node begins pulsing as workload increases
- Connected tasks show active state
- Quality noise begins appearing on tasks
- Person pulse intensity increases over time

**Burnout cascade:**
- Person node suddenly freezes/darkens (burnout threshold crossed)
- All connected task lines sever
- Tasks visually stall (blocked state)
- Quality noise frozen on those tasks

**Recovery illusion:**
- Person returns to visual calm (workload reduced)
- But burnout can still occur shortly after (stress persists)
- Observer surprised: "It looked fine!"

**Distributed stress:**
- Multiple people showing subtle overload signs
- No single person looks critical
- Sudden multi-person burnout creates visual collapse

### Scale for Emergence:

**Minimum viable complexity:**
- 4-6 people
- 10-15 tasks
- 8-12 dependencies

**Why:** Creates sufficient density for patterns (cascades, waves, propagation) to be visible.

**NOT for decoration - for consequence modeling at scale.**

---

## PROHIBITED ELEMENTS (Stages 2-3):

**Remove entirely:**
- All event logs
- All "Cause:" explanations
- All numeric state values (stress, quality risk, workload ratios)
- All aggregate metrics (completion counts, blocked counts)
- All status labels ("normal", "overloaded", "at risk")
- All tooltips explaining state
- All causal analysis text
- Reset/undo buttons
- Progress bars
- Dashboard panels
- Summary statistics

**If it explains WHY something happened during execution, it violates silence.**

---

## STAGE 4: REVIEW MODE (OPTIONAL)

**Only built if core simulation (Stages 2-3) passes all resistance tests.**

### If Built, Review Must Be:

**Visual replay, not textual analysis:**

**Timeline Scrubber:**
- Horizontal timeline
- Drag to scrub through past states
- Field updates to show state at that time step
- NO event annotations on timeline

**State Overlays (toggle-able):**
- Stress accumulation shown as heat map overlay on people
- Quality risk shown as increasing noise/blur on tasks
- Burnout moments visible as state transitions
- NO explanatory text - just visual state history

**What It Shows:**
- "At step 7, Bob's node began pulsing (overload)"
- "Between step 7-56, stress accumulated (visual intensity)"
- "At step 65, sudden darkening (burnout)"
- Observer sees causality through replay, not reading

**What It Does NOT Show:**
- "Cause: Workload 3 exceeded capacity 2"
- "Contributing factors: bullet list"
- "Total overload duration: 12 steps"
- Numeric stress values or thresholds

**Stage 4 Test:**
User reviews failed session, understands what happened, but cannot undo it. Feels "I see what went wrong, but it's too late."

---

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Visual Technology Stack:

**Recommended:**
- Canvas-based rendering (HTML5 Canvas or SVG for performance)
- Force-directed graph layout for spatial arrangement
- Smooth state transitions (CSS/Canvas animations)
- Color/opacity/motion as primary state indicators

**NOT:**
- HTML lists with CSS styling
- Table-based layouts
- Text-heavy component trees

### Color Language (Example):

**People:**
- Normal: `#6B7280` (neutral gray)
- Overloaded: `#F59E0B` (amber) with pulse
- Burned Out: `#374151` (dark gray), 60% opacity, frozen

**Tasks:**
- Pending: outline only, `#D1D5DB`
- In Progress: `#3B82F6` (blue), solid
- Blocked: `#9CA3AF`, disconnected
- Completed: `#10B981`, subdued

**Quality Degradation:**
- CSS filter: `blur(0-3px)`, `grayscale(0-40%)`
- Noise texture overlay (subtle)

**These are examples - calibrate in Stage 2.2 based on emergence legibility.**

### Animation Timing:

**Overload pulse:**
- Duration: 2-3s ease-in-out loop
- Increases in frequency/amplitude with stress

**Burnout transition:**
- Snap: 300ms transition to dark/frozen state
- Immediate - not gradual

**Task state changes:**
- Smooth: 500ms transitions between states
- Quality degradation: accumulates gradually (no discrete jumps)

### Accessibility Considerations:

**Motion:**
- Pulse/vibration should be subtle (reduced motion compliance)
- State must be distinguishable by color + pattern, not motion alone

**Color:**
- Use sufficient contrast ratios
- Test colorblind-safe palettes
- Combine color with other cues (opacity, pattern, position)

## VALIDATION TESTS

### Stage 2 Acceptance:

**Test 1: Silent Observation**
Run simulation for 20 steps. Count text explanations during execution.
- **Pass**: Zero explanatory text appears
- **Fail**: Any tooltip, label, or "cause" statement visible

**Test 2: Visual Burnout Detection**
Overload person until burnout. Observer watches without reading text.
- **Pass**: Observer says "Something suddenly happened to that person"
- **Fail**: Observer needs to read state label to understand

**Test 3: Quality Degradation Subtlety**
Complete tasks under overload. Ask observer "Did these tasks complete successfully?"
- **Pass**: Observer uncertain - sees completion but senses wrongness
- **Fail**: Quality problems are obvious or invisible (calibration needed)

**Test 4: Looks Healthy While Dying**
Run simulation where tasks progress but stress accumulates.
- **Pass**: System looks stable 2-3 steps before burnout
- **Fail**: Problems visible early enough to prevent

### Stage 3 Acceptance:

**Test 5: Late Intervention Insufficiency**
Let burnout approach, then reassign tasks. Continue simulation.
- **Pass**: Burnout still occurs despite correct action
- **Fail**: Late intervention feels effective

### 30-60 Second Reaction Test:

Show to unfamiliar observer. Let them watch/interact for 60 seconds.

**Target reactions:**
- "Something is spreading/cascading"
- "This looks unstable"
- "I can't tell exactly what's wrong"
- "Oh... this is serious"

**Failure reactions:**
- "Cool visualization"
- "What does this measure?"
- "Let me optimize the workload distribution"

---

## DECISION POINT: STAGE 4

**After Stage 3 completes, explicitly decide:**

**Build Stage 4 if:**
- You want post-session learning without real-time help
- Visual replay would demonstrate system depth
- Core resistance (Stages 1-3) is bulletproof

**Skip Stage 4 if:**
- Maximum resistance is priority over explanation
- Ambiguity should remain even after session ends
- You want observers to replay sessions themselves to understand

**Stage 4 is optional. Stages 1-3 must be complete first.**

---

## ANCHOR STATEMENTS

**What this redesign accomplishes:**
"Transform from explanatory dashboard to observable emergence - consequences become visible through spatial patterns, not metrics."

**What success looks like:**
"An observer watches the field for 60 seconds and says 'Something went wrong but I can't pinpoint when' - not 'Bob's stress hit 50 at step 65.'"

**The Game of Life parallel:**
"You see cells change, you infer the rules, you cannot undo history. That's the entire system."

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Audit current codebase**: Identify all metric displays, event logs, explanatory text
2. **Remove violations**: Delete event timeline, causal analysis, numeric indicators, reset button
3. **Prototype spatial layout**: Canvas/SVG field with person nodes + task entities
4. **Implement state visuals**: Color, opacity, motion for overload/burnout/quality
5. **Calibrate emergence**: Test with 5-6 people, 12-15 tasks until patterns are legible
6. **Run validation tests**: Silent observation, visual detection, 30-60 second reaction
7. **Freeze Stage 2**: Once resistance tests pass, lock visual language
8. **Build Stage 3**: Add reassignment interaction that preserves resistance
9. **Decide Stage 4**: Explicit choice to build or skip retrospective explainability
